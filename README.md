##Ismael's Snake Game in Java

This was a project made my me at my university time back in 2010. I know there are a lot of bad code on this :p
But my real goal is to port this little game to **jruby** so that's why I'm sharing it here.

###Play

You can download and compile it but there is also a .jar already made for you to just run it :)

###How it looks?

###Don't know Portuguese?

Yeah, I'm still doing translations so that's why the mixing of languages.
